#  AI-Enhanced SQL Query System 💡

This project contains a collection of intelligent SQL query solutions that demonstrate how structured query language can be used to simulate logic-driven data operations — the foundation of many AI systems.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project covers key SQL techniques including:

- ✅ Subqueries
- ✅ Table Joins
- ✅ String manipulation
- ✅ Date filtering
- ✅ Conditional logic (`CASE`)
- ✅ Data updates and deletions

Each scenario reflects how AI systems reason, decide, and act using structured data.
